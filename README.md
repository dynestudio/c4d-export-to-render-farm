**Export to Render Farm** provides a alternative way to collect a c4d file with additional features.   
Writen by: Carlos Dordelly

----------------

### Overview
The utility of this script is speed up and improve our collect workflow when we render with multiple machines with TR (local team render, server or client) or a render manager software. Unlike the original function from c4d, this script ask you if you want to open or not the collected file and it create a detailed log with the render information. You can use it to upload scenes to render farms services too and keep the log information for you.   

Supported render engines for log:   

-Arnold Renderer (C4DtoA).   
-Redshift Renderer.  
-Octane Renderer (half support).  
-Physical Renderer.   
-Standard Renderer.   
 
Also, we called "Safety Checks" to our favorite feature. Sometimes we forgot enable some important options of our scenes and we render without it (i.e. sometimes we forgot to activate the multipass export). When we use Export to Render Farm the script enable some safety checks in case that we forgot to enable it.
